      "description": "chemfp is a set of command-lines tools for generating cheminformaticsnfingerprints and searching those fingerprints by Tanimoto similarity,nas well as a Python library which can be used to build new tools.nnThese algorithms are designed for the dense, 100-10,000 bitnfingerprints which occur in small-molecule/pharmaceuticalnchemisty. The Tanimoto search algorithms are implemented in C fornperformance and support both threshold and k-nearest searches.nnFingerprint generation can be done either by extracting existingnfingerprint data from an SD file or by using an existing chemistryntoolkit. chemfp supports the Python libraries from Open Babel,nOpenEye, and RDKit toolkits.n",
